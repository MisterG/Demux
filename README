Description:

The program is used to enqueue its input and process it thanks
to a user-defined command running into threads. It can be useful to launch
several mono-threaded workers to process a large number of elements :
 - bzip2 / gzip a list of files ;
 - use a shell script to process a list of files...

Example:
find . -name "*.bz2" | dm bzip2\ -d 4 -
